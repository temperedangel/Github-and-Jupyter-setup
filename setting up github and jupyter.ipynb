        "`.info()` gives a few useful pieces of information. First, it has a `RangeIndex` that tells us how many rows are in the `DataFrame`. In this case, we have 2000 rows of data. We can also see the column names in the `DataFrame`. For each column, we see the number of *non-null* values &nbsp; how many values in each column are present vs. missing. Thankfully, we don't have any missing values in this dataset. Finally, we can see the `dtype` or data type for each column. Some of these are `int` for integer, `bool` for boolean (e.g., True or False) or just generic `object`...those are often text strings. `.info()` tells us a lot about the types of data we have and if we need to deal with missing values."

For instance, focus on the column named `math_score`. You can see the mean math_score is 83.452, the standard deviation from the mean is 12.36, etc. You can also see the minimum and maximum values in each column as well as the quartile values (25%, 50%, 75%). `.describe()` is useful when we start doing exploratory data analysis to get a high-level picture of our data.  \n",
